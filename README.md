# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Outline
Task: Create, design and implement a web-based application capable of running SQL queries and displaying the results of said query. The application must include a space which accepts SQL queries in the form of user inputs, then runs the given query, and displays the result within the application..

### Important Points:
1. This is a dummy application.
2. You must include a space to accept SQL queries.
3. Your application does not need to have a backend, a query engine or query validation.
4. You do not need to add any syntax validation.
5. The data that your application displays can be any chunk of data. It does not need to be the actual result that the query would display if it was actually run.
6. The data and the query do not need to be in sync.
7. You can write down any query you wish. The query is not important, nor is the result. You are free to put in dummy stubs and mocks wherever the need arises.
8. Your application must have more than one query accompanied by its corresponding table of data.
9. You can have a predefined set of queries and a predefined set of tables showing some data. You must also provide a way for us to toggle between these queries and choose any query and view the table of data accompanying it. It can be a dropdown or any other toggling mechanism.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
